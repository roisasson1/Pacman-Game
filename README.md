# Pacman Console Game

This project is a console-based Pacman game implemented in C++.The game includes classic Pacman gameplay with some additional features and improvements.

## Features

- **Basic Pacman Gameplay**: Move Pacman using the keys to eat breadcrumbs, avoid ghosts, and earn points.
- **Ghosts**: Two ghosts move at half the pace of Pacman, providing a challenge.
- **Screen Wrapping**: Pacman can travel through invisible tunnels from one side of the screen to the other.
- **Fruit**: A randomly appearing fruit worth 5-9 points, adding an extra layer of challenge.
- **Smarter Ghosts**: Different levels of ghost AI (BEST, GOOD, NOVICE).

## Testing and Saving (Exercise 3)

- **Loading Screens from Files**: Load game screens from text files, allowing for custom game levels.
- **Load and Save Games**: Record and replay games from files for testing purposes.
- **Silent Mode**: Run the game in silent mode for automated testing.

## Techniques and Concepts Used

- **Algorithms**: utilizing an algorithm for the ghosts to try to catch Pacman.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game design leverages OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism**: Implemented through the different behaviors of Pacman and the ghosts.
